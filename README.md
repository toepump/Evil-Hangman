Evil-Hangman
============
Evil Hangman is a sadistic twist on the classic word game.

Using a large list of words, the game will ask the user for the length of word that we want to guess.
Then, the computer will choose a word from the list that matches the specified length.

With each guess that the user makes, the computer will change the "Correct" word to one that is further from the user's guess.

In other words, the algorithm allows the computer to quickly determine what type of word will allow for the most outcomes 
based on the user's guess, and choose that word.
